# hello-world
My first repo

Hello, this is Stelios.

I am new to programming and i want to learn how to build awesome stuff.

I also found my first job on the 1st of this month and it seems that i could build some great knowledge and gain strong experience working in this company.

But to do this more stress-free and evolve faster, i need to devote some free time as well.

Thanks for your time.
S.P.
